I believe that the primary motivation for Open Science ([Poisot et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.4033/iee.2013.6b.14.f), [Stodden and Miguez 2014](http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.ay)) is to make science more transparent to outsiders and to enable less experienced people to see how "science is made". To this end, I publish the data and source code for all of the projects that I lead. In addition, I have published (and/or maintain) several open source software packages.
