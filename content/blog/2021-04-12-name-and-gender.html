<p>This post serves as a notice of my name and gender. <strong>I go by Jemma or “Jem” for short and I use they/them pronouns</strong> (or she/her in a pinch).</p>
<p>I considered writing a long post touching on transgender 101 topics, my personal journey, and the hopes/fears associated with being transgender. However, given that I am not a scholar of transgender science/philosophy, I don’t want to appear to speak for all trans people, and my story is not really that unique among trans people, I’ve decided to simply curate a list of links at the end of this post. The personal essays broadly reflect my own experience.</p>
<p>I ask that everyone reading this use my current name Jem (Jemma) and pronouns (they/them &gt; she/her) whenever possible, educate themselves to at least a minimal degree on transgender topics (see References), and give themselves space for reflection on their own gender. If you are questioning your gender and find in person support-groups/talk-therapy intimidating, unavailable, or insufficient, know that there are more informal online communities filled with people who want to help.</p>

<h2>References</h2>
<p>This is not a comprehensive list. It has recency bias, it is heavily slanted towards transgender women, and does not really touch on issues of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality">intersectionality</a>.</p>
